        <!--First title along with a paragraph describing computer memory-->
        <h2>What is Computer Memory?</h2>

        <p>
            Computer Memory is a physical device located inside the computer, that is capable of storing 
            information temporarily <b><a href ="RAM.html">(RAM)</a></b> (random access memory) or permanently 
            <b><a href ="ROM.html">(ROM)</a></b> (read-only memory). Both of these devices utilize integrated 
            circuits that are used by the operating systems, the hardware and the software of a computer. 
        </p>

        <h2>What does Computer Memory look like?</h2>

        <p>
            Below is a close-up example of <b><a href ="RAM.html">(RAM)</a></b>. It is a 1 GB RAM Chip, laptop 
            memory module. This memory module connects to the memory slot on the motherboard of a computer.

        <!--Third title with a paragraph explaining volatile and non-volatile memory-->
        <h2>Volatile vs. Non-volatile Computer Memory</h2>
        
        <p>
            Computer Memory can be either volatile or non-volatile. Volatile memory loses its contents when 
            the computer or hardware is powered off. Computer <b><a href ="RAM.html">(RAM)</a></b> is an 
            example of volatile memory, if your computer turns off while you are working on a document saved 
            in the <b><a href ="RAM.html">(RAM)</a></b>, you will lose anything that hasn't been saved on that 
            document. Non-volatile memory is the opposite, it does not lose its contents, even when abruptly
            powered off. <b><a href ="ROM.html">(ROM)</a></b> is an example of non-volatile memory. This video
            explains more about volatile and non-volatile memory.

        <!--Fourth title with a paragraph explaining disk storage-->
        <h2>Computer Memory is not disk storage</h2>

        <p>
            New computer users might be confused by what parts of the computer are memory. Although 
            both the hard drive and <b><a href ="RAM.html">(RAM)</a></b> are forms of memory, it is more 
            fitting to refer to <b><a href ="RAM.html">(RAM)</a></b> as "memory" or "primary memory" and 
            the hard drive as "storage" or "secondary memory".
