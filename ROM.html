        <!--First title along with a paragraph explaining ROM-->
        <h2>ROM breakdown</h2>

        <p>
            ROM is a storage medium that is used with computers and similar electronic devices. As the name 
            indicates, data stored in ROM can only be read. It cannot be modified under normal circumstances 
            and is mostly used for firmware updates. A simple example of ROM are cartridges used with video 
            game consoles, which allows one system to run a multitude of games.

        <!--Second title along with a paragraph explaining where ROM is-->
        <h2>Where is the ROM on a computer?</h2>

        <p>
            Typically, most computers have their ROM on the computer motherboard. There are some exceptions, and
            some expansion cards and devices may have their own ROM.

        <!--Third title along with a paragraph the BIOS and ROM-->
        <h2>BIOS and ROM</h2>

        <p>
            Almost every computer comes with a small amount of ROM containing the boot firmware. 
            This consists of a few kilobytes of code that tell the computer what to do when it starts up, 
            e.g., running hardware diagnostics and loading the operating system into RAM. On a PC, the boot 
            firmware is called the BIOS (see below). (Basic Input/Output System)
        </p>

        <!--Fourth title along with a paragraph explaining the past and future of ROM-->
        <h2>Past and Future of ROM</h2>

        <p>
            Originally, ROM was actually read-only. To update the programs in ROM, you had to remove 
            and physically replace your ROM chips. Contemporary versions of ROM allow some limited rewriting, 
            so you can usually upgrade firmware such as the BIOS by using installation software. Rewritable ROM 
            chips include PROMs (programmable read-only memory), EPROMs (erasable read-only memory), EEPROMs 
            (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory), and a common variation of EEPROMs called 
            flash memory. (see image below)
