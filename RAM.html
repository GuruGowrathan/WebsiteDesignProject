        <h2>Types of RAM</h2>

        <p>
            Over the years and the evolution of the computer, there have been different variations of RAM. 
            Some of the more common examples include DIMM, RIMM, SIMM, SO-DIMM, and SOO-RIMM. The image below is 
            an example of RIMM computer memory module. This memory module would be installed into one of the 
            memory slots on a motherboard.

        <!--Second title along with a paragraph explaining additional RAM information-->
        <h2>Additional RAM information</h2>

        <p>
            As the computer starts up, parts of the operating system and drivers are loaded into memory, 
            which allows the CPU (central processing unit) to process the instructions faster and speeds up the  
            boot process. After the operating system has started up, each program you open, such as the browser you're 
            using to view this page, is loaded into memory while it is running. If too many programs are open,
             the computer will swap the data in the memory between the RAM and the hard disk drive.
            <br>
            <br>
            The performance and speed of a computer is largely attributed to the quantity of memory that can 
            be stored within it. If a computer does not have enough memory to run the operating system and the 
            software programs, it results in slower performance. In short, the more memory a computer has, the 
            more information and software it can load and process quicker.

        <h2>How much RAM can I have?</h2>

            Currently, the largest available stick of RAM is 128 GB. This can be seen in the image below.
